### Project Pitch

#### The opportunity

Suppose you are an architect, you just finished your very important and prestigious project. Your presentation is coming up and you need to present it to the customer. To make the graphics more appealing you want to show it in a realistic scenario but you’re short on time.

Designing a whole environment from scratch is very time consuming and using the same models for the same things e.g tress/cars over and over again looks unnatural and sterile. Wouldn’t it be great to have a way to easily solve this problem?

#### The idea

We propose the idea to design a Fusion 360 plugin for the above problem. The plugin would generate various different Models, for example trees, cars, or people. It will have parameters to adjust the Models for example we can adjust the size range, or the design details to make it different each time.

Now imagine, the architect could use our plugin to create models for a lively environment for his project. He would then be able to create a much more appealing presentation without spending a lot of his time on creating the environmental models and can focus on more important tasks instead.
